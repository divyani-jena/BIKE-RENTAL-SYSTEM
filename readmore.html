    Bike rental is a service that provides bicycles for temporary use, typically for a fee. Bike rental companies may offer various types of bicycles, including road bikes, mountain bikes, city bikes, and e-bikes. The service is popular among tourists and commuters who need a bike for a short period of time, but do not want to invest in purchasing a bike or carrying it with them.

Bike rental companies typically operate in urban areas or tourist destinations, where there is a high demand for bikes. Many companies offer online booking services, allowing customers to reserve bikes in advance. Some companies also offer guided bike tours, which can be a great way to explore a new city or area.

In recent years, bike rental has become more popular as a sustainable transportation option, as it allows people to travel without relying on cars or public transportation. Some bike rental companies have even introduced electric bikes, which can make cycling more accessible for people who may not be able to ride a traditional bike due to physical limitations or the terrain.

When renting a bike, it's important to consider safety precautions such as wearing a helmet and following traffic laws. It's also important to inspect the bike before renting it, to ensure that it is in good working condition and that all the necessary safety features are in place.
